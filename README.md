# markdown-prism-revealjs-decktape-printing

Bunch of stuff so I can be able to use decktape to generate a PDF from my presentations.

Just edit the `print-presentation.sh` script and run it:

    ./print-presentation.sh

The PDF should be generated. (If there are any details missing - like `bower install` or PhantomJS download - the script will let you know and give further instructions.)
